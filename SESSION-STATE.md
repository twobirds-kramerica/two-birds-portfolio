# Session State — Two Birds Innovation
**Last Session:** April 12, 2026 (Session 23 -- Employability Dossier)
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) via Claude Code CLI

---

## Session 23 -- Employability Dossier Foundation ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-12 ~14:43-14:52 EST (Toronto)
**Machine:** EZbook

### What Was Built
Evidence base for CV and job applications. Does NOT contain a CV. Contains the raw material.

**Files created in `career/employability-dossier/`:**
- `skills-inventory.md` -- 9 skills with evidence from 180+ commits and 21 sessions
- `gap-analysis.md` -- honest gaps (2 high-severity: no paid AI eval, CA$0 MRR) with closers
- `short-term-gig-research.md` -- 7 platforms researched. Top 3: Outlier, Surge, Scale
- `full-time-target-roles.md` -- 5 role types with real postings. Top fit: Product Ops (70%)
- `cv-interview-questions.md` -- 29 questions for Aaron (mostly multiple choice)
- `README.md` -- how to use the dossier

### Key Finding
Anthropic actively hires for Product Operations and Safeguards roles that don't require CS/ML. "About half our technical staff had no prior ML experience." Cohere (Toronto) is the most Canada-friendly AI company but their job board was down during research.

### Next Action
**Aaron answers the 29 CV interview questions (15-20 min).** The CV gets built from the answers.

---

## S-001: Voice Keyword Command Map ✅ (auto-run)

**Date:** 2026-04-12 | **Trigger:** "next sprint"
**Built:** `command-map.json` (12 commands), `command-matcher.js` (fuzzy matcher, 10/10 tests pass), `README.md` (wiring docs)
**Layer:** L4-native — pure JS, no dependencies
**Next READY sprint:** S-003 (Content Freshness System)

---

## Phase 0 Verification Run ✅

**Date/Time:** 2026-04-11 ~23:20 EST (Toronto)
**Result:** SUCCESS. 1 item found in pending-capture.md, routed to backlog/stories.md as SC-001 (P3 story), queue cleared, committed as `c31b1dc`, pushed to master.
**Issues found:** None. The full capture→merge loop works end-to-end.

---

## Session 21 — Capture System (Full Build) ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~22:41-23:00 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### What Was Built
Complete capture system: pending queue, prompt generator (with honesty rules + emergency P1 handling), mandatory Phase 0 in all sprints (auto-merge captured items), and Claude.ai userPreferences addition for one-time setup.

### Files Created/Updated
- `hal-stack/sprint-system/pending-capture.md` — capture queue
- `hal-stack/sprint-system/capture-prompt.md` — instructions for any Claude instance (honesty rules, emergency P1)
- `hal-stack/sprint-system/sprint-template.md` — updated with mandatory Phase 0
- `hal-stack/sprint-system/sprint-queue.md` — Phase 0 reminder added
- `hal-stack/sprint-system/user-preferences-addition.md` — one-time Claude.ai setup

### The Complete Loop
1. **Run:** "next sprint" → Claude Code executes (Phase 0 merges pending captures first)
2. **Retro:** retro prompt in Claude.ai → status report
3. **Capture:** "capture: X" in any Claude chat → generates paste-ready prompt
4. **Merge:** Aaron pastes into Claude Code → item queued → next sprint auto-merges

### Next Actions
1. Add userPreferences text to Claude.ai settings (2 min, one-time)
2. Test capture: type "capture: test item" in fresh Claude.ai chat
3. Upload Two Birds logo to LinkedIn (still pending)

---

## Session 20 — DCC V07 Finalized + Brand Research Imported ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~18:29-18:35 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### What Was Done
- DCC logo V07 (heart-bulb) finalized — 12 format files generated
- Master brand research imported from Gemini (sovereignty vs autonomy, Essentialism+Lovability, motto/mantra, name research with ALOFT front-runner)
- DCC trademark & copyright guidelines added
- Sprint S-002 marked DONE, S-008 unblocked
- Updated: brand guidelines, culture spec, sovereignty principles

### Key Discovery
"Two Birds Innovation" is a PLACEHOLDER name. ALOFT is front-runner. Decision PARKED by Aaron.

### Next Actions
1. Create LinkedIn company page + upload logo
2. Buy domains twobirdsinnovation.com and .ca
3. Read updated brand guidelines

---

## Session 19 — Human Backlog Consolidation ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~16:30-16:35 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### What Was Done
- Scanned all session results (S11-S18), questions, sprint queue, stories, brand docs, persona docs, and Claude.ai export (115 conversations)
- Consolidated 25 human action items into master `human-backlog.md` (2 NOW, 9 SOON, 9 LATER, 5 DONE)
- Mapped 56 employment-related conversations from Claude.ai export
- Created `employment-recovery.md` — what exists, what's recoverable, recommendation to recover only baseline CVs

### Key Finding
Employment/career work was 49% of all Claude.ai usage (56 of 115 conversations). The career-to-consulting pivot happened around late February / early March 2026. Key assets (baseline CVs, cover letters, LinkedIn plan) exist in Claude.ai project storage, not in any git repo.

### Next Actions
1. Upload Two Birds logo to LinkedIn (2 min — flagged 4 times now)
2. Pick DCC logo variation (5 min — unblocks sprint S-002)
3. Skim human-backlog.md — do NOW items, review SOON items

---

## Session 18 — Sprint Automation System ✅

| S-008 | DCC CSS Brand Alignment | BLOCKED |

### Next Actions
1. Upload Two Birds logo to LinkedIn (2 min)
2. Try "next sprint" command — paste from `next-sprint-mobile.txt`
3. Open `human-backlog.md` — do the NOW items

---

## Session 17 — Branding Finalization + DCC Logo ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~15:50-16:00 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

## Session 16 — Cross-Context Ingestion ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~15:22-15:35 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### What Was Done
Processed Aaron's complete Claude.ai data export (12.7 MB, 115 conversations, Nov 2025 — Apr 2026).

### Key Numbers
- 115 conversations scanned, 4,745 total messages
- 14 projects with 110 attached documents
- 18 HIGH relevance conversations identified
- 9 deep extractions created
- 0 contradictions with current architecture

### Top 5 Discoveries
1. **No "faceless brand plan" document exists** — it's a values thread. Now in culture-spec.md.
2. **HAL was "voice-first" from Day 1** (March 6 origin conversation)
3. **Swarm agents discussed 2 months before formal boardroom doc** (Feb 12)
4. **Content freshness is a 5-week-old Day 1 requirement, still not started** (E6)
5. **Aaron deliberately imports personas across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini** — multi-LLM diversity already in practice

### Files Created
- `ingestion/export-inventory.md` — file structure analysis
- `ingestion/conversation-map.md` — all 115 conversations classified
- `ingestion/extracted/` — 9 deep extraction files
- `ingestion/DISCOVERY-REPORT.md` — full findings with actions
- Updated: `context-index.md`, `culture-spec.md`, `backlog/epics.md`

### Privacy
Raw data stays local (gitignored). Only summaries and classifications pushed.

### Next Actions
1. Read DISCOVERY-REPORT.md (5 min)
2. Decide: promote content freshness (E6) to P2?
3. Pick a logo variation (still pending from Session 14)

---

## Session 15 — Persona Framework + Sovereignty Hardening ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~01:57-02:10 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### Part A — Persona & Swarm Framework

**Phase 1: Persona Architecture** (`0e83a0b`)
- `personas/README.md` — swarm model, weighting, model routing overview
- `personas/persona-schema.md` — standard template for any persona
- `personas/culture-spec.md` — protect work > customer > Aaron. Essentialism, loveability, "why why why"

**Phase 2: 6 Departments** (`a299227`)
- Engineering: Naveen (VP), Sam (Sr Dev), Jordan (DevOps), Priya (QA)
- Marketing: Ava (CMO), Theo (Brand), Maya (Content), Kai (Social)
- Strategy: Claire (CSO), Ethan (Research), Rosa (Innovation), Leo (BizModel)
- Legal-Risk: Helen (GC), Anil (Privacy), Nora (IP), Dani (Risk)
- Finance: Raj (CFO), Fatima (Cost), Marcus (Revenue), Lin (Bookkeeper)
- Operations: Val (CoS/EA), Drew (PM), Casey (Knowledge), Riley (Parking Lot)

**Phase 3: Weighting + Profiles** (`ec531c8`)
- Weight 0-3 dial system, 6 pre-built profiles (Quick Decision, Brand & Launch, Architecture Decision, Full Boardroom, Solo Founder, Sovereignty Review)
- Model routing: Executives→Opus, Specialists→Sonnet, Front-line→Haiku/local

### Part B — Sovereignty Hardening

**Phase 5: Full Decapitation Audit** (`9557ae4`)
- 12 components audited L1-L4: Claude Code, Claude.ai, GitHub, Pages, Formspree, Cloudflare, Whisper, context bridge, personas, Node, PowerShell, Windows
- Result: GOOD overall. No HIGH risk. DNS is least sovereign. Formspree best-insured.

**Phase 6: Local Backup Architecture** (`9980098`)
- `architecture/local-backup.md` — Pentium Silver as dumb git mirror, auto-sync script, failover procedure

**Phase 7: Sovereignty Dashboard** (`1f746e7`)
- Red/yellow/green status table added to sovereignty-principles.md

**Phase 4: Skill Library** (`eb1ea00`)
- Schema + 3 starter skills: brand-identity-review, sovereignty-audit, sprint-prompt-writing

### Next Actions
1. Aaron reviews persona departments — are the names and compositions right?
2. Aaron picks a logo variation (from Session 14)
3. Aaron requests Claude.ai data export (if not already done)

---

## Session 14 — Logo Variations + HAL Architecture ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~01:20-01:35 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### Part A — Logo v1.2 (`7df7a03`)
- 10 variations in `assets/logos/two-birds/variations/` (SVG + 512px PNG each)
- COMPARISON-NOTES.md and DESIGNER-RECOMMENDATION.md
- **Designer's pick: V04 (fraternal stroke weights)**
- Aaron to review and select before LinkedIn upload

### Part B — HAL Architecture

**Phase 1: Context Bridge Rework** (`dc4e400`)
- Auto-export workflow — Aaron's overhead reduced to ~30 seconds
- claude-code-auto-export.md — copy-paste block for sprint prompts

**Phase 2: Ingestion Infrastructure** (`9499c16`)
- `context-system/ingestion/` — ready for Claude.ai data export
- Complete sprint prompt for processing the export when it arrives

**Phase 3: Boardroom Vision** (`e134d43`)
- `architecture/boardroom-vision.md` — multi-agent workspace with culture spec
- Personas protect work > customer > Aaron. Push back. Challenge. Not yes-men.
- L4 personal machine: air-gapped, never synced, personal Aaron context
- E10 + E11 epics added to backlog

**Phase 4: Voice Thinking Layer** (`7cad021`)
- New component between STT and Command Router
- Conversational LLM that refines raw speech, asks clarifying questions, refuses scope creep
- L4 fallback: simple keyword matcher (no LLM needed)

### Aaron's Key Decisions (recorded from today's session)
1. Context exports = automated by AI, not manual Aaron work
2. Voice needs a "thinking layer" — thought partner, not dictation tool
3. HAL Boardroom = multiple machines with dedicated AI personas
4. One machine must be L4-only, air-gapped, never synced (personal context)
5. GitHub L4 fallback = local git on Pentium Silver
6. Claude.ai data export = prerequisite for context ingestion (Aaron requesting tomorrow)
7. Personas should push back, challenge, come prepared — not yes-men
8. Company vision: innovation, disruption, essentialism, loveability, real development culture

### Next Actions
1. Aaron requests Claude.ai data export
2. Aaron reviews 10 logo variations, picks one
3. Aaron reads boardroom-vision.md, decides timeline

---

## Session 13 — Review-Assist Sprint ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-10 ~20:49-21:00 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### Phase
Review-assist sprint — auditing the overnight HAL sprint output (Session 12)

### Files Created
- `hal-stack/sessions/overnight-review-guide.md` — plain-English summaries (`c137a48`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/overnight-self-audit.md` — file-by-file consistency check (`c2473e2`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/overnight-decisions.md` — 14 autonomous judgment calls (`e0a3c15`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/questions-for-aaron.md` — 8 questions blocking next sprint (`92d2e47`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/2026-04-10-review-sprint-RESULTS.md` — session results (this commit)

### Key Findings
- 19 issues found (0 high, 7 medium, 12 low)
- "Shipped" terminology misleading (should be "documented")
- Voice layer pricing unverified — don't budget from those numbers
- Logo v1.1 status contradicts across files
- Whisper cost estimate is optimistic (~600 min, not 800)

### Next Action
Aaron reads `overnight-review-guide.md` first (5 min, phone-friendly), then `questions-for-aaron.md` (5 min), then decides next sprint scope.

---

2. **Review logo v1.1** against spec — decide rework or ship
3. **Skim sovereignty-principles.md** (15 min) — validate the foundation

---

## Session 11c — Logo v1.1 ✅

### Changes from v1.0
- Both chevrons changed to white (#FFFFFF) — unified brand, cleaner read
- Added open-end circles (one per chevron): top chevron upper-left, bottom chevron lower-right — fraternal twins
- Added subtle cosmos/universe texture (~60 semi-transparent white dots at 8-15% opacity)
- Recentred composition with 140px minimum padding (was 120px)
- Composition bounding box now symmetrically centred at canvas midpoint (512, 512)

### Files Updated
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-logo.svg` — master vector
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-1024.png` — 1024px
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-512.png` — 512px
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-256.png` — 256px
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-favicon.ico` — 16/32/48px

---

## Session 11b — Branding Foundation (Logo Generation) ✅

### Phase
Branding foundation — logo generation

### Files Created
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-logo.svg` — master vector (854 bytes)
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-1024.png` — LinkedIn / social media (35 KB)
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-512.png` — general web use (12 KB)
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-256.png` — high-res favicon (4 KB)
- `assets/logos/two-birds/two-birds-favicon.ico` — browser favicon, multi-size 16/32/48 (2 KB)
- `assets/logos/two-birds/README.md` — design spec, intent, usage guidelines

### Commit
`653f5f4` — pushed to master on two-birds-portfolio

### Skipped
Full branding guidelines document — deferred per Aaron's request

### Next Recommended Action
Upload `two-birds-1024.png` to LinkedIn company page. Schedule full branding guidelines session when ready.

---

## Session 11 — Form Hardening Sprint (Brenda Fix) ✅

### Trigger
Real user (Brenda, early tester) submitted onboarding form April 3 with almost every field blank. Investigation revealed 6 forms sharing one Formspree endpoint with inconsistent validation.

### Files Modified (digital-confidence repo)
1. `js/setup-wizard.js` — Removed Formspree POST from onboarding captureEmail(). Email now saved to localStorage only. Onboarding is a welcome flow, not feedback capture.
2. `js/feedback-github.js` — Added `form_type: "site_feedback"` differentiator. Required validation on message (min 10 chars) and feedback_type. Replaced alert() with inline error messages (role="alert", calm tone). Submit button disabled until valid, re-enabled on input.
3. `beta/beta-survey.html` — Removed `novalidate` bug from form tag. Added `required` to Q1 (confidence), Q2 (most helpful module), Q4 (felt respected), Q5 (would recommend), Q7 (testimonial permission). Q3/Q6/Q8/Q9 left optional by design.

### Commit
`c986fbb` — pushed to main on digital-confidence

### Explicitly Deferred
- `js/email-capture.js` — works as designed, has form_type, not in scope
- `beta/beta-landing.html` — already has required attrs, working
- `b2b/index.html` — high-value B2B form, needs its own deliberate session
- Forensic hidden fields (page_url, referrer, user_agent, viewport) — backlogged
- Success/error state improvements — existing states are fine
- Accessibility audit via axe-core — added role="alert" to inline errors statically; full browser QA deferred to next session

### Security Finding
Web3Forms key `5e0ecf7e-...` in `js/feedback-github.js` line 647 is client-side. Investigated and confirmed: Web3Forms access keys are public form identifiers (like Formspree endpoint IDs), not secret API keys. **Not a P0 Gate violation.** No action needed.

### Next Recommended Action
Aaron should submit one test entry on the hardened feedback modal to confirm inline validation works. No site-wide regression testing needed — only three files were touched.

---

## Session 10 — Mega Architecture Sprint ✅

### Quality Infrastructure
- QA Framework: accessibility + AODA + bilingual checks + mobile layout + P0 gate
- 4 test personas with scenarios (Brenda, Adult Child, SME Owner, Library Director)
- Product scores: Career Coach 31, Aaron P 34, Clarity 38, TBI 38, DCC 43 (out of 60)
- axe-core QA panel deployed to 4 products (?qa=true trigger)

### Design System
- Typography scale, colour system (WCAG AA verified), component library
