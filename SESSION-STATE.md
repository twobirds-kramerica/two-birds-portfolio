## Session 16 — Cross-Context Ingestion ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~15:22-15:35 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### What Was Done
Processed Aaron's complete Claude.ai data export (12.7 MB, 115 conversations, Nov 2025 — Apr 2026).

### Key Numbers
- 115 conversations scanned, 4,745 total messages
- 14 projects with 110 attached documents
- 18 HIGH relevance conversations identified
- 9 deep extractions created
- 0 contradictions with current architecture

### Top 5 Discoveries
1. **No "faceless brand plan" document exists** — it's a values thread. Now in culture-spec.md.
2. **HAL was "voice-first" from Day 1** (March 6 origin conversation)
3. **Swarm agents discussed 2 months before formal boardroom doc** (Feb 12)
4. **Content freshness is a 5-week-old Day 1 requirement, still not started** (E6)
5. **Aaron deliberately imports personas across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini** — multi-LLM diversity already in practice

### Files Created
- `ingestion/export-inventory.md` — file structure analysis
- `ingestion/conversation-map.md` — all 115 conversations classified
- `ingestion/extracted/` — 9 deep extraction files
- `ingestion/DISCOVERY-REPORT.md` — full findings with actions
- Updated: `context-index.md`, `culture-spec.md`, `backlog/epics.md`

### Privacy
Raw data stays local (gitignored). Only summaries and classifications pushed.

### Next Actions
1. Read DISCOVERY-REPORT.md (5 min)
2. Decide: promote content freshness (E6) to P2?
3. Pick a logo variation (still pending from Session 14)

## Session 15 — Persona Framework + Sovereignty Hardening ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~01:57-02:10 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### Part A — Persona & Swarm Framework

**Phase 1: Persona Architecture** (`0e83a0b`)
- `personas/README.md` — swarm model, weighting, model routing overview
- `personas/persona-schema.md` — standard template for any persona
- `personas/culture-spec.md` — protect work > customer > Aaron. Essentialism, loveability, "why why why"

**Phase 2: 6 Departments** (`a299227`)
- Engineering: Naveen (VP), Sam (Sr Dev), Jordan (DevOps), Priya (QA)
- Marketing: Ava (CMO), Theo (Brand), Maya (Content), Kai (Social)
- Strategy: Claire (CSO), Ethan (Research), Rosa (Innovation), Leo (BizModel)
- Legal-Risk: Helen (GC), Anil (Privacy), Nora (IP), Dani (Risk)
- Finance: Raj (CFO), Fatima (Cost), Marcus (Revenue), Lin (Bookkeeper)
- Operations: Val (CoS/EA), Drew (PM), Casey (Knowledge), Riley (Parking Lot)

**Phase 3: Weighting + Profiles** (`ec531c8`)
- Weight 0-3 dial system, 6 pre-built profiles (Quick Decision, Brand & Launch, Architecture Decision, Full Boardroom, Solo Founder, Sovereignty Review)
- Model routing: Executives→Opus, Specialists→Sonnet, Front-line→Haiku/local

### Part B — Sovereignty Hardening

**Phase 5: Full Decapitation Audit** (`9557ae4`)
- 12 components audited L1-L4: Claude Code, Claude.ai, GitHub, Pages, Formspree, Cloudflare, Whisper, context bridge, personas, Node, PowerShell, Windows
- Result: GOOD overall. No HIGH risk. DNS is least sovereign. Formspree best-insured.

**Phase 6: Local Backup Architecture** (`9980098`)
- `architecture/local-backup.md` — Pentium Silver as dumb git mirror, auto-sync script, failover procedure

**Phase 7: Sovereignty Dashboard** (`1f746e7`)
- Red/yellow/green status table added to sovereignty-principles.md

**Phase 4: Skill Library** (`eb1ea00`)
- Schema + 3 starter skills: brand-identity-review, sovereignty-audit, sprint-prompt-writing

### Next Actions
1. Aaron reviews persona departments — are the names and compositions right?
2. Aaron picks a logo variation (from Session 14)
3. Aaron requests Claude.ai data export (if not already done)

---

## Session 14 — Logo Variations + HAL Architecture ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-11 ~01:20-01:35 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### Part A — Logo v1.2 (`7df7a03`)
- 10 variations in `assets/logos/two-birds/variations/` (SVG + 512px PNG each)
- COMPARISON-NOTES.md and DESIGNER-RECOMMENDATION.md
- **Designer's pick: V04 (fraternal stroke weights)**
- Aaron to review and select before LinkedIn upload

### Part B — HAL Architecture

**Phase 1: Context Bridge Rework** (`dc4e400`)
- Auto-export workflow — Aaron's overhead reduced to ~30 seconds
- claude-code-auto-export.md — copy-paste block for sprint prompts

**Phase 2: Ingestion Infrastructure** (`9499c16`)
- `context-system/ingestion/` — ready for Claude.ai data export
- Complete sprint prompt for processing the export when it arrives

**Phase 3: Boardroom Vision** (`e134d43`)
- `architecture/boardroom-vision.md` — multi-agent workspace with culture spec
- Personas protect work > customer > Aaron. Push back. Challenge. Not yes-men.
- L4 personal machine: air-gapped, never synced, personal Aaron context
- E10 + E11 epics added to backlog

**Phase 4: Voice Thinking Layer** (`7cad021`)
- New component between STT and Command Router
- Conversational LLM that refines raw speech, asks clarifying questions, refuses scope creep
- L4 fallback: simple keyword matcher (no LLM needed)

### Aaron's Key Decisions (recorded from today's session)
1. Context exports = automated by AI, not manual Aaron work
2. Voice needs a "thinking layer" — thought partner, not dictation tool
3. HAL Boardroom = multiple machines with dedicated AI personas
4. One machine must be L4-only, air-gapped, never synced (personal context)
5. GitHub L4 fallback = local git on Pentium Silver
6. Claude.ai data export = prerequisite for context ingestion (Aaron requesting tomorrow)
7. Personas should push back, challenge, come prepared — not yes-men
8. Company vision: innovation, disruption, essentialism, loveability, real development culture

### Next Actions
1. Aaron requests Claude.ai data export
2. Aaron reviews 10 logo variations, picks one
3. Aaron reads boardroom-vision.md, decides timeline

## Session 13 — Review-Assist Sprint ✅

### Date/Time
2026-04-10 ~20:49-21:00 EST (Toronto)
Machine: EZbook

### Phase
Review-assist sprint — auditing the overnight HAL sprint output (Session 12)

### Files Created
- `hal-stack/sessions/overnight-review-guide.md` — plain-English summaries (`c137a48`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/overnight-self-audit.md` — file-by-file consistency check (`c2473e2`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/overnight-decisions.md` — 14 autonomous judgment calls (`e0a3c15`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/questions-for-aaron.md` — 8 questions blocking next sprint (`92d2e47`)
- `hal-stack/sessions/2026-04-10-review-sprint-RESULTS.md` — session results (this commit)

### Key Findings
- 19 issues found (0 high, 7 medium, 12 low)
- "Shipped" terminology misleading (should be "documented")
- Voice layer pricing unverified — don't budget from those numbers
- Logo v1.1 status contradicts across files
- Whisper cost estimate is optimistic (~600 min, not 800)

### Next Action
Aaron reads `overnight-review-guide.md` first (5 min, phone-friendly), then `questions-for-aaron.md` (5 min), then decides next sprint scope.

## Session 11 — Form Hardening Sprint (Brenda Fix) ✅

### Trigger
Real user (Brenda, early tester) submitted onboarding form April 3 with almost every field blank. Investigation revealed 6 forms sharing one Formspree endpoint with inconsistent validation.

### Files Modified (digital-confidence repo)
1. `js/setup-wizard.js` — Removed Formspree POST from onboarding captureEmail(). Email now saved to localStorage only. Onboarding is a welcome flow, not feedback capture.
2. `js/feedback-github.js` — Added `form_type: "site_feedback"` differentiator. Required validation on message (min 10 chars) and feedback_type. Replaced alert() with inline error messages (role="alert", calm tone). Submit button disabled until valid, re-enabled on input.
3. `beta/beta-survey.html` — Removed `novalidate` bug from form tag. Added `required` to Q1 (confidence), Q2 (most helpful module), Q4 (felt respected), Q5 (would recommend), Q7 (testimonial permission). Q3/Q6/Q8/Q9 left optional by design.

### Commit
`c986fbb` — pushed to main on digital-confidence

### Explicitly Deferred
- `js/email-capture.js` — works as designed, has form_type, not in scope
- `beta/beta-landing.html` — already has required attrs, working
- `b2b/index.html` — high-value B2B form, needs its own deliberate session
- Forensic hidden fields (page_url, referrer, user_agent, viewport) — backlogged
- Success/error state improvements — existing states are fine
- Accessibility audit via axe-core — added role="alert" to inline errors statically; full browser QA deferred to next session

### Security Finding
Web3Forms key `5e0ecf7e-...` in `js/feedback-github.js` line 647 is client-side. Investigated and confirmed: Web3Forms access keys are public form identifiers (like Formspree endpoint IDs), not secret API keys. **Not a P0 Gate violation.** No action needed.

### Next Recommended Action
Aaron should submit one test entry on the hardened feedback modal to confirm inline validation works. No site-wide regression testing needed — only three files were touched.
